        <h4>Getting to UIUC</h4>
	<p>Getting to UIUC is a... time-consuming process. Here are the options, listed roughly in order of convenience and cost. Many of the options assume you will be flying into Illinois (or a neighboring state).</p>
          <h5>From Chicago</h5>
	    The public transit system is great! Here's the basics.
	    <h6><b>Airports</b></h6>
	      There are two airports in Chicago: O'Hare International Airport (ORD) and Midway National Airport (MDW). ORD is the larger of the two and typically cheaper, but also usually has longer lines for security and longer distances from security to gates because the ongoing expansion and renovation projects. MDW is the smaller of the two and typically a bit more expensive, but much less busy than ORD and much more comfortable to travel through (and has actually decent food).
